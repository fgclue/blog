Hello, I used to have a blog running on fgclue.wordpress.com. It still exists, but is now a archive. 

## Why I switched
I decided to switch because most of the things that WordPress has, are paid.
I don't have money to pay for WordPress other plans.

It has a banner to advertise WordPress, which I need to pay to remove;
I can't make my own CSS without paying;
I have to pay if I want to use more themes;
I can't get 4K video.

Also, I'd like to thank WordPress for showing "Remove this site banner with a paid plan" right after I published the post on my old blog.
