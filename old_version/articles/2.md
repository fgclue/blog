So for a while, I installed linux into my PC. I switched distros about 4 times. At the moment, I'm using Fedora, and it works perfectly. I tried using Linux Mint, Ubuntu and MX Linux, but Fedora does everything right. 

## Desktop enviroments
### Cinnamon
I loved using Cinnamon. It looks like windows, it just felt right when I started using Linux. I used to use Windows 10 and 7, so I was very familiar with Cinnamon. I stopped using Cinnamon because Terraria broke, for some reason some textures weren't showing and some were low quality. I then switched to GNOME.
### GNOME
I use GNOME daily now, I installed Dash to Dock and color picker, to make it easier to ose. I love Dash to dock, since it makes the dock show up always. The only problem is that sometimes the Application selected thing shows low quality. I don't know why this problem is happening, It's only happening on Obsidian, the only problem I'm having is that 

I'm going to continue using Linux, I like it and I'm having no problems.
