                    Hello, I used to have a blog running on fgclue.wordpress.com. It still exists, but is now a archive. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h2>Why I switched</h2>
                    I decided to switch because most of the things that WordPress has, are paid.
                    I don't have money to pay for WordPress other plans.
                    <br><br>
                    It has a banner to advertise WordPress, which I need to pay to remove;
                    I can't make my own CSS without paying;
                    I have to pay if I want to use more themes;
                    I can't get 4K video.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, I'd like to thank WordPress for showing "Remove this site banner with a paid plan" right after I published the post on my old blog.
                </p>
